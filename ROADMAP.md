# Roadmap

This document tracks planned work, research items, and future enhancements for the WhiteLabel UI Library.

## Recently Completed (Needs Testing)

### Theme Builder Integration Readiness
- **Status**: ✅ Completed - ⚠️ **Needs Testing**
- **Date**: 2024-11-28
- **Completed Items**:
  1. ✅ Created `components.manifest.json` at project root with all 8 public components
     - Includes NavBar, Footer, Hero, TextSection, ImageSection, ProductSlider, RecipeSlider, FAQ, SocialMediaFeed
     - Organized by categories (Navigation, Layout, Content Sections, Feature Components)
     - Contains component descriptions, import paths, and safe default props for Theme Builder rendering
  2. ✅ Updated `package.json` to include `components.manifest.json` in files array
     - Verified via `npm pack --dry-run` that file is included in published package
  3. ✅ Created `docs/TOKEN_TO_CSS_MAPPING.md` documentation
     - Documents CTI token structure to CSS variable name conversion patterns
     - Includes mapping tables for all token types (colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows, grid)
     - References Style Dictionary transforms and compiled CSS output
     - Includes Theme Builder UI control mapping guidance
  4. ✅ Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` Data Contracts section
     - Clarified three-manifest structure:
       - Design tokens (`tokens/**/*.json`) - Source of truth for visual design values
       - Theme manifest (`theme.manifest.json`) - Component metadata and configuration
       - Components manifest (`components.manifest.json`) - Component discovery metadata
     - Documented how Theme Builder consumes each manifest type

- **Testing Required**:
  - Verify `components.manifest.json` structure is valid JSON and correctly formatted
  - Test that Theme Builder can successfully read and parse `components.manifest.json` from installed package
  - Verify component default props render correctly in Theme Builder preview environment
  - Test that all 8 components can be discovered and rendered using manifest defaults
  - Validate token-to-CSS mapping documentation accuracy against actual compiled CSS output
  - Confirm package publishing includes `components.manifest.json` in final tarball

## What Still Needs to be Done

### Documentation Organization
- **Separate documentation** into contributor-facing and consumer-facing docs
  - Status: Needs research on best approach
  - Consider: Separate README files, dedicated docs site, or structured sections

### Automated Documentation Generation
- **Generate documentation/changelog** for every NPM package version automatically
  - Status: Needs implementation
  - Requirement: Generated by Cursor/AI agents
  - Consider: Automated changelog from git commits, API documentation from TypeScript types

### Token System Research
- **Define/reorganize tokens** - Research what would be the best amount of tokens, their names and values
  - Status: Needs research
  - Consider: Industry best practices, token naming conventions, optimal token count for maintainability

### Image Components
- **Responsive Image Component** - Picture tag component that accepts 2 images (mobile and desktop)
  - Status: ✅ Completed
  - Requirements:
    - At least one image is required (mobile or desktop)
    - If only one image is provided, use it for both mobile and desktop
    - Always include `width` and `height` attributes on fallback/mobile image
    - Always add CSS `aspect-ratio` with matching media queries
  - After creation: Update all existing components to use this component properly
    - Status: Pending - Components created, migration to existing components pending

- **Image Component** - Standard image component with required props
  - Status: ✅ Completed
  - Required props: `src`, `alt`, `width`, `height`
  - After creation: Update all existing components to use this component properly
    - Status: Pending - Components created, migration to existing components pending

## Future Enhancements

- **Theme Editor GUI** – Visual interface for creating and editing themes
- **AI contrast / copy QA** – Automated accessibility and content quality checks
- **Multi-brand previews** – Side-by-side comparison of multiple brand themes
- **Manifest diff migrations** – Automated migration tools for manifest schema changes

## Notes

This roadmap is flexible and will evolve as the project grows. Items may be reprioritized or removed based on project needs and feedback.
