# Roadmap

This document tracks planned work, research items, and future enhancements for the WhiteLabel UI Library.

## What Still Needs to be Done

### Documentation Organization
- **Separate documentation** into contributor-facing and consumer-facing docs
  - Status: Needs research on best approach
  - Consider: Separate README files, dedicated docs site, or structured sections

### Automated Documentation Generation
- **Generate documentation/changelog** for every NPM package version automatically
  - Status: Needs implementation
  - Requirement: Generated by Cursor/AI agents
  - Consider: Automated changelog from git commits, API documentation from TypeScript types

### Token System Research
- **Define/reorganize tokens** - Research what would be the best amount of tokens, their names and values
  - Status: Needs research
  - Consider: Industry best practices, token naming conventions, optimal token count for maintainability

### Image Components
- **Responsive Image Component** - Picture tag component that accepts 2 images (mobile and desktop)
  - Status: Needs implementation
  - Requirements:
    - At least one image is required (mobile or desktop)
    - If only one image is provided, use it for both mobile and desktop
    - Always include `width` and `height` attributes on fallback/mobile image
    - Always add CSS `aspect-ratio` with matching media queries
  - After creation: Update all existing components to use this component properly

- **Image Component** - Standard image component with required props
  - Status: Needs implementation
  - Required props: `src`, `alt`, `width`, `height`
  - After creation: Update all existing components to use this component properly

## Future Enhancements

- **Theme Editor GUI** – Visual interface for creating and editing themes
- **AI contrast / copy QA** – Automated accessibility and content quality checks
- **Multi-brand previews** – Side-by-side comparison of multiple brand themes
- **Manifest diff migrations** – Automated migration tools for manifest schema changes

## Notes

This roadmap is flexible and will evolve as the project grows. Items may be reprioritized or removed based on project needs and feedback.
